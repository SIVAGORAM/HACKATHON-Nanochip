Title: "AI-Driven Energy Optimization in Industrial 4.0: Advancing Production Sustainability"

Abstract:
Industrial and commercial enterprises grapple with the dual challenge of managing energy costs while mitigating environmental impact. Conventional energy management systems often prove inadequate, requiring manual intervention and lacking precision. Addressing these challenges necessitates an AI-powered approach leveraging machine learning and data analytics. This paper proposes an AI-driven energy management system that collects real-time data from sensors and meters to predict usage patterns and identify energy-saving opportunities. By automating the regulation of energy-consuming devices, such as lighting and HVAC systems, the system optimizes consumption while seamlessly integrating with existing building automation systems. The goal is to empower businesses to reduce costs, enhance operational efficiency, and minimize environmental footprint. Key outcomes include significant cost savings, heightened energy efficiency, reduced carbon emissions, scalability, and user-friendly operation. This approach offers a sustainable solution for managing energy consumption in industrial and commercial settings.

Keywords: AI-driven energy optimization, industrial 4.0, sustainability, energy management, machine learning, data analytics, sensor integration, operationalÂ efficiency.
